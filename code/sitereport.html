            <h1>Sitereport</h1><br>
            <p>The 'Web Development' module assignment was an engaging challenge that required us to create a portfolio website showcasing the foundational skills and knowledge acquired during the course. Using HTML to build the site structure and CSS for styling, the task pushed us to develop a responsive, multi-page website that adheres to modern design principles. My project includes five interconnected pages: Home, Portfolio, Contact, Work Experience, and Site Report, all of which feature a navigation bar and a responsive hamburger menu.

                To approach this assignment systematically, I planned the structure of each page based on the requirements and then implemented the design step by step. Below, I outline the development process for each page.<br>
                   1.	Home page: <br>
                        The home page serves as an introduction to the site, featuring a brief overview about me. At the start of the module, we practiced using basic HTML elements, tags and embedding images. Building on that foundation, I structured the home page to include a navigation menu, a responsive hamburger menu, and a main content section.<br>
                   2.	Projects page:<br> On the projects page, I implemented a column-based layout to demonstrate my skills. The navigation and hamburger menus were added first, followed by columns to showcase images and text descriptions of projects. Placeholder links were included for future projects, allowing visitors to explore additional content in the future.<br>
                   3.	Contact page:<br> On the contact page, I’ve designed a form that allows potential clients to reach out via the social media links and email address they’ve shared. The form includes fields for entering their name, email address, and a message. A submit button is created using the button tag. To enhance the page, I’ve incorporated social media icons from FontAwesome and used Google Fonts, which required adding external script tags linking to those resources for proper functionality.<br>
                   4.	VideoDemo page:<br> This page contains the video link of this assignment which I have uploaded on YouTube.<br>
                   5.   Sitereport page:<br> The site report page documents my experience with web development, covering the learning process, design decisions, and challenges encountered. It includes screenshots of the development progress and validation reports for HTML and CSS.<br>
                   <br>
                   Design:<br>
                   Through the project, I learned how to use CSS for styling and formatting web pages. Understanding CSS syntax and its interaction with HTML took time, but with guidance from my professor, online tutorials, and discussions with classmates, I was able to create a cohesive design.<br>
                   •	Color: <br>
                   The website features a white and black color scheme inspired by Apple’s clean aesthetic. I added navy blue, my favorite color, to highlight my name and logo for a personal touch.<br>

•	Box-shadow:<br>
The portfolio page uses the box-shadow property to create a subtle hovering effect, with the shadow darkening on hover for interactivity.<br>

•	Hover:<br>
The hover property is also used in the website's portfolio section.<br>

•	Font:<br>
The "Roboto" font was chosen for its modern and clean appearance, while the "Permanent Marker" font was used to emphasize my name on the home page.<br>

<br>
Challenges:<br>
One of the initial challenges was implementing a functional navigation bar, which I resolved with support from my professor. Another significant challenge was making the hamburger menu responsive and consistent across all pages. After some research and help from a friend, I was able to implement it successfully.<br>
<br>
Reflection and Insights:<br>

This project gave me a deeper understanding of web development best practices. I realized the importance of:<br>

•   Consistency: Maintaining a uniform style across all pages improves user experience.<br>
•   Validation: Valid code ensures better performance and accessibility.<br>
•   Version Control: Regular commits to GitHub helped track progress and provided an essential safety net.<br>
Conclusion:<br>
This assignment was a valuable learning experience, helping me gain foundational knowledge in web development. While HTML and CSS presented a steep learning curve, practice and persistence helped me overcome challenges and create a functional and visually appealing website. Completing this project gave me confidence in my ability to design and develop web pages.
